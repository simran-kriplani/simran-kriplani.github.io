[{"content":"Hi there! I am a third-year Biology and Psychology student at the University of Toronto with a strong passion for understanding the intersection of health and human behaviour. My academic journey has been shaped by a broad foundation in the life sciences, complemented by rigorous coursework and various projects in psychology and virology. These experiences have strengthened my ability to critically evaluate scientific literature and solve real-world problems.\nThrough my experiences at MyLab Discovery Solutions and the Serum Institute of India, I gained hands-on exposure to diagnostic testing and biomedical research. Furthermore, my leadership roles in student-led organizations allow me to translate neuroscience and psychology concepts into impactful communication.\nMy particular interest in clinical psychology and cognitive neuroscience led me to explore the biological and cognitive mechanisms underlying mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and neurodegenerative diseases. I hope to apply this knowledge in healthcare and research. I am eager to connect with professionals and researchers in the psychology and public health fields!\nMy Resume # For more information View My Resume\n","date":"8 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/my-first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"8 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"8 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Welcome to PawsPortfolio","summary":"","title":"Welcome to PawsPortfolio","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
