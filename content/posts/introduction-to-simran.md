+++

I am a third-year **Biology and Psychology** student at the **University of Toronto** with a strong passion for understanding the intersection of health and human behaviour. My academic journey has been shaped by a broad foundation in the life sciences, complemented by _rigorous coursework_ and various projects in psychology and virology. These experiences have strengthened my ability to critically evaluate scientific literature and solve real-world problems.

Through my experiences at **MyLab Discovery Solutions** and the **Serum Institute of India**, I gained hands-on exposure to **diagnostic testing** and **biomedical research**. Furthermore, my leadership roles in student-led organizations allow me to translate **neuroscience and psychology concepts** into impactful communication.

My particular interest in **clinical psychology** and **cognitive neuroscience** led me to explore the biological and cognitive mechanisms underlying mental health conditions such as **anxiety, depression, and neurodegenerative diseases**. I hope to apply this knowledge in healthcare and research. I am eager to connect with professionals and researchers in the **psychology and public health fields**!
